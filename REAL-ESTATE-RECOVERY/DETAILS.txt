Hey, Victor, Matt. So, Jeff Nash wanted a map to go with a story I’m doing for Wed. Since Flo is out, do you think one day (Tue) is enough time for her to do it? Or would one of you guys be willing to jump in and start it today? Here are the details, if that helps.
 
WHAT WE WANT: map coloring states my sources see as possible next recovery areas and a few pins on specific cities.
